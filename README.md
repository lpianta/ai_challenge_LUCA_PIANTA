Submitting AI Challenges solved for evaluation.

Thank you for the opportunity, I did my best even though I just started learning to code and I have never coded in Python before.


One little hint for the statistics challenge: I'm colorblind, so it was pretty hard for me to understand the number of colored balls in the boxes. Maybe you can improve that,
for people with the same problem, by adding a textual description to the image. I say this not to criticize but to help, I hope you don't take it personal.

I hope to hear from you soon!

Best Regards


Luca
