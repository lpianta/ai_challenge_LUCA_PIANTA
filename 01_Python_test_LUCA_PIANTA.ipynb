Having candidates which meet this criteria is essential in order to deliver on the promice of you all getting a good job position after this one finishes.\n",

    "In this assignment you will complete a Jupyter notebook (`01_Python_test_NAME_SURNAME.ipynb` file) with a number of function definitions. Do **not** submit a python file or any other format. Independently of your working environment, copy the final code and results in the notebook. \n",

    "## Instructions \n",
    "\n",
    " - The estimated duration of the assignment is **1h approx**. If it is your first time with Python, maybe a bit more. \n",
    " - You will see that not all the instructions are given to complete an exercise. Show us how you tackle uncertain problems ;)\n",

    "This is an individual assignment. You **are** allowed to look up specific coding syntax questions and answers on Stack Overflow and similar websites and adapt them, but you **are not allowed to copy and paste entire solutions** into your submission. As a rule of thumb, do not copy and paste from the internet anything larger than one line of code into your submission.\n",

    "We receive hundreds of admission tests and **run automated testing to identify similar code**. If you cheat, not only will you get caught, but you are not the type of person that would finish the course in the first place.
